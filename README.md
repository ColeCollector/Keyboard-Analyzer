A keyboard layout analyzer made using kivy. Used to see diferent metrics relating to how comfortable/fast a keyboard layout is. For example SFB stands for same finger bigram and happens when two keys are typed one after the other and both in the same row. These metrics are found through simulating typing a set of words which are compacteded into the corpus folder.
